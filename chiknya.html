        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            hello my name is Varad Gurav im a student studying in zeal engineering college , 
            i have a passion for riding bikes travelling gym and sports , i"ve always wanted to join NDA but due to some family reasons i gave up on my dream ,
             so after that i gave up on my studies as well and 
            I"ve always been a guy who loves to explore more not just sitting on front bench and study , 
            meet new people explore more and study less trying to focus more on self grwoth and peronal development getting in shape eat clean 
            its always better to eat boring and look delicious rather than eating delicious amd look bore
             <br>

            <b>Personal Interests:</b>
            Im just a chill guy , mostly i"ll be somewhere in mountains or riding bikes 
            i deadlift 150kgs , i love sports , everyday i wake up a see myself as conor mcgregor/virat kohli
            i love travelling and exploring<br>

            <b>Goals and Aspirations:</b>
            I just wanna make my parents proud no matter what , goal is to earn enough money so that i could buy anything my eyes looks up for , plan is to get my dream bikes before i turn 30 , i have to be in a good shape 
            I'll be getting tattoos and try different things , as I"ve grown up watching hardik pandya , david beckham <br>

            <b>RISKS:</b>
            when i was 15 year old , i did my swimming classes and i was so damn confident that i though i"ll compete nationals , so with this confidence when i had gone to my village there was this beautiful river so i dived in , i was there uptill 1 hour and then when i felt done i went home with my chest up *lol* telling everyone that i dived into that river so right after saying this i got a tight slap from my grandfather telling me that the river has crocodiles in it , my eyes litrlly popped up i was shocked aswell i got beaten up by my family members and after that 
            one i dropped projector on a school van as the projector was hanging on a wall , because someone told me i got rough fingers so i untied the rope and boom
            i"ve got cops running after me to catch me but later on they got to know who"s the real G in this game almost created a dhoom scene over there after this i just got audition for dhoom 4

        <h3>Object Detection System</h4>
            Data Scientists who are just starting their careers can develop skills in the field of computer vision with
            this project. An object detection system can identify classes of objects present within an image by
            utilizing computer vision techniques in the background. For example, suppose an image contains a picture of
            you working on a laptop. In that case, an object detection system should be able to identify and label you
            (human) and the computer, along with your position in the image.

            Project Idea: You can use Kaggleâ€™s Open Images Object Detection dataset for this project. There is a
            pre-trained object detection model that has been made open-source called SSD. This model was trained on a

            
            dataset of everyday objects called COCO and can identify things like tables, chairs, and books. You can
            further train the output layer of this model on the Kaggle Open Images dataset to build your object
            detection system with high accuracy.

            Dataset: Kaggle Open Images Object Detection Dataset

            Tools and Libraries: TensorFlow, OpenCV</p>
